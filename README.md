# Kumpli Mosaic

A self-hosted “memories processor + sandbox” for Boo & Maa.

This project is a **local-first, read-only archive intelligence system** that builds a durable metadata layer over our photos, videos, audio, and texts (20+ years, multi-TB). The core goal is to make our archive **searchable, explorable, and surprising** — while staying transparent and fully under our control.

It’s not a “platform.” It’s a **personal laboratory**:

* run modern models and tools (faces, embeddings, OCR, ASR, quality checks)
* store every result as an artifact with **lineage**
* see partial results early (long runs shouldn’t be blind)
* experiment safely in **sandbox mode**
* attach small UIs for review/naming/annotation when needed

Principles

* Originals are sacred: the archive is **read-only** and never modified.
* Metadata is the product: results are stored as artifacts, not “magic”.
* Lineage is mandatory: every artifact explains how it was produced.
* Replaceable modules: try tools freely without locking the system to one ecosystem.
* Results-first: implement only what we need to use the system.
